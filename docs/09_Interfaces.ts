/* 
In TypeScript, interfaces are a way to define the shape 
or structure of an object. They describe the properties and 
methods that an object should have, but they don't provide 
any implementation. Interfaces allow you to enforce a contract
between different parts of your code, ensuring consistency 
and interoperability.
